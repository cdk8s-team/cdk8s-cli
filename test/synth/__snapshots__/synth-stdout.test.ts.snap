                  a namespaced 'composite resource claim' CRD that corresponds to
                  the defined composite resource. This composite resource claim acts
                  as a namespaced proxy for the composite resource; creating, updating,
                  or deleting the claim will create, update, or delete a corresponding
                  composite resource. You may add claim names to an existing CompositeResourceDefinition,
                  but they cannot be changed or removed once they have been set.
