### A command-line-interface for CDK for Kubernetes

**cdk8s** is a software development framework for defining Kubernetes
applications using rich object-oriented APIs. It allows developers to leverage
the full power of software in order to define abstract components called
"constructs" which compose Kubernetes resources or other constructs into
higher-level abstractions.

To install the CLI use one of the following methods:

* Homebrew: `brew install cdk8s`
* npm: `npm i -g cdk8s-cli`
* yarn: `yarn global add cdk8s-cli`

> **Note:** This repository is the command-line tool for cdk8s that is published as [`cdk8s-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cdk8s-cli). For more general information about cdk8s, please see [cdk8s.io](https://cdk8s.io), or visit the umbrella repository located at [cdk8s-team/cdk8s](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s).
